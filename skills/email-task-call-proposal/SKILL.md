# Email Task Call Proposal

## Purpose

This skill helps an assistant notice work in email, task, and calendar systems
that needs an external follow-up. It chooses the least surprising channel
available — an existing booking system, email, or phone — and creates a
structured proposal for a human to review. It does not place a call while
reading sources or drafting the proposal.

The intended host workflow is:

`email/task/calendar evidence → channel proposal → human approval → follow-up → structured result`

## Use this skill when

- an email, task, or calendar event explicitly asks for a callback,
  confirmation, reschedule, availability check, or another bounded follow-up;
- a calendar event needs to be reorganized and the original booking channel is
  known or can be inferred from direct source evidence; and
- the recipient and an exact contact method are present in the source or a
  directly matched contact record.

## Do not use this skill when

- the phone number or email address is missing, ambiguous, guessed, or found
  only in an unrelated contact record;
- the task can be completed safely by email, a draft, a calendar action, or a
  normal task update;
- the source does not establish why this recipient should be called;
- the user has not approved the proposal; or
- the call would require making a legal, medical, financial, purchasing, or
  other consequential decision on the user's behalf.

## Channel selection

When a user asks to reorganize or reschedule an event, inspect how it was
originally arranged before choosing a channel:

1. Check durable channel memory for the exact person/business and situation
   first. A specific memory such as "reschedule appointment → phone" overrides
   a general preference, but never apply a memory to a merely similar business.
2. Use the original booking system when the event contains a supported booking
   link or provider identifier.
3. Use email when the source thread or directly matched contact has an email
   address and the business normally handles changes there.
4. Use CALL-E when the business has no usable email or booking workflow, the
   source/contact has an explicit phone number, and the requested change can be
   stated as one bounded call goal. A hair appointment with a phone-only
   salon/barber is a canonical example.
5. If more than one channel is plausible, present the choice in the proposal
   instead of silently trying several channels. Never create duplicate email
   and phone follow-ups for the same event without separate approval.

When the user explicitly tells you that a person or business uses a particular
channel, a completed interaction establishes it, or an email, calendar event,
task, or contact record explicitly establishes it, save that fact with the
host's channel-memory tool. Include the source reference when the fact came
from workspace data. Record the situation as well as the channel; update an
existing matching subject/situation memory rather than creating a duplicate.
Do not save an inferred preference.

## Proposal workflow

1. Read the bounded email/task/calendar context and identify the exact source
   event or work item.
2. Match the recipient only to a directly relevant contact or an explicit
   address/number in the source. Never infer contact details from a name.
3. Create one channel-specific proposal. For a call, use `call_task` and
   include the source reference, recipient, explicit phone number, reason, call
   goal, and expected result fields.
4. Show the user the proposed channel, the source event, the requested change,
   and a masked phone number when applicable. The proposal must remain pending
   until the user explicitly approves it.
5. After approval, the host calls CALL-E through its server SDK or Developer
   API. Use an idempotency key derived from the proposal id.
6. Poll or receive the CALL-E result until it reaches a terminal state. Record
   the CALL-E call id, terminal status, summary, and structured result.
7. Treat `no_answer`, `voicemail`, `unclear`, rejection, timeout, and ambiguous
   outcomes as unresolved. Do not claim that the requested task was completed.
8. Create any follow-up calendar, email, or task mutation as a separate
   approval-gated proposal.

## Safety rules

- Proposal generation is read-only and must never invoke CALL-E or send email.
- A real call requires explicit approval of the recipient, phone number, and
  goal shown in the proposal.
- Mask phone numbers in user-facing previews and logs; send the full number
  only to CALL-E's authenticated API request.
- Never expose `CALLE_API_KEY` in prompts, logs, proposal text, or results.
- Do not silently retry a call. A timeout or ambiguous result requires human
  reconciliation before another attempt.
- Do not treat a call result as permission to send email, edit a calendar, buy,
  or otherwise act. A confirmed reschedule should produce a separate,
  source-linked calendar-update proposal unless the host's approval contract
  explicitly included that exact calendar mutation.
- If the source evidence is insufficient, return no proposal and explain what
  is missing.

## Host contract

The host should provide the input evidence and implement the proposal and
execution boundaries. See [references/proposal-contract.md](references/proposal-contract.md)
for the portable proposal and result shapes.

CALL-E's server SDK and Developer API are supported integration paths for a
trusted backend. MCP may be used by a host that already has a secure,
authenticated MCP client, but it is not required for this workflow.
